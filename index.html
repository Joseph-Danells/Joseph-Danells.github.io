                        <p>
                            I'm Joe Danells, a student currently enrolled New Brunswick Community Collage(NBCC), about to begin my career in the IT industry. 
                            I enjoy learning new things and the challenges that often accompany that pursuit of knowledge and skill.
                            The time I spend developing my skills mostly consists of taking things apart only to try putting them back together, 
                            each failed attempt offering more insight into how that item functions. 
                            This deconstructive approach to learning has helped me build an analytic mindset as understanding the creations that you tear apart,
                            be it a small electrical circuit, motor vehicle, or snippet of code, requires a precise attention to detail and willingness to take risks.

                            My current work experience only consists of various customer service positions and the odd labour job here and there.
                            Though my interest in IT has existed since high school, namely in app development/coding.
                            Java has been my language of choice as I was introduced to it first and have used it in most of my personal projects since.

                                One of my few side projects, development has been halted for the time being as school demands my full attention.
                                This mod project aims to add new game play elements to the popular game <i>MineCraft</i><sup>TM</sup> 
                                revolving around low orbit objects and the adverse affects caused when they break through the atmosphere and impact the land.
                                This project was start as a means of practicing java coding and creating something of my own for fun.<br>
